### CI: OpenAI secret validation & E2E smoke test 🔬

We added GitHub Actions workflows to validate that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and to perform a safe end‑to‑end smoke test that starts the app and calls `/api/recycle/recommend`. See the status badges above and the flow diagram in `docs/diagrams/openai-secret-flow.mmd` for details.

## 🚀 Get Started

### 🎨 Visuals & small renders

- Emoji stack (render): `docs/diagrams/emoji-stack.svg`

#### 🖼️ Render diagrams locally

You can render Mermaid `.mmd` sources to SVG and PNG locally with the provided helper script:

```powershell
# From the repository root
# - downloads a portable Node 24.x if missing (wait longer with -LongTimeout)
# - runs mermaid-cli to produce SVGs
# - installs Puppeteer (Chromium) and converts SVG -> PNG at configurable scale
.
.\scripts\render-local.ps1 [-LongTimeout] [-RenderScale <scale>]
```

Options:
- `-UseNvm -AcceptUAC` — use nvm-windows installer (requires UAC) instead of the portable Node download.
- `-SkipChromiumDownload` — skip Puppeteer's Chromium download if you already have a compatible Chromium in PATH.
- `-LongTimeout` — use longer timeouts & retries for downloads/Chromium install (helpful on flaky networks).
- `-RenderScale <n>` — set PNG scale (default 2, CI uses 4 for hi-res).

Notes & tips:
- Puppeteer will download Chromium (100+ MB); allow time and network access. ⚠️
- The script writes PNGs to `docs/diagrams` and lists generated PNG files when finished. ✅
- For CI rendering we provide `.github/workflows/render-diagrams.yml` which runs on GitHub runners and uploads PNG artifacts.

### Android `antigravity` module
A small Kotlin Android module skeleton has been added at `android/antigravity/`. It includes Gradle files and a placeholder `MainActivity`. Add `google-services.json` to `android/antigravity/app/` if integrating Firebase (do not commit it; see `.gitignore`).

### Google Cloud SDK helpers
Scripts added under `scripts/`:
- `scripts/setup-gcloud-sdk.ps1` — download and (optionally) install Google Cloud SDK on Windows, and initialize it interactively.
- `scripts/gcloud-auth.ps1` — authenticate with a service account JSON and set a project non-interactively.
- `scripts/gcloud-startup.ps1` — interactive helper to sign in as `ceanskiier27@networkbuster.net`, set project, and enable common APIs (or run non-interactive service-account auth).

## 📦 Distribution & Installation (Windows)  

- Build artifact (ZIP): `npm run dist:zip` — creates `dist/<name>-<version>.zip` with required files.  
- Create desktop launcher: `npm run release:create-shortcut` — creates a shortcut called "NetworkBuster Launcher" on the current user desktop pointing to `start-desktop.bat`.  
- Build NSIS installer: `npm run dist:nsis` — builds an NSIS installer (requires NSIS / makensis in PATH).  
- Start from desktop: Double click the created shortcut or run `npm run start:desktop`.  

Notes:  
- The packaging scripts rely on `node`/`npm` being available in PATH and use PowerShell `Compress-Archive` on Windows.  
- For a branded installer include an ICO at `scripts/installer/icon.ico` or place SVG/PNG assets in `scripts/installer/branding/`. You can generate an ICO from `scripts/installer/icon-placeholder.png` using `scripts/installer/convert-icon.ps1` (requires ImageMagick `magick`).  
- An End User License Agreement (`scripts/installer/EULA.txt`) is bundled into the installer and is required.  
- To test locally on Windows see `scripts/test-local-build.ps1` (requires Node, npm, Git, NSIS, and optionally ImageMagick).  
- For CI, add a job that runs `npm run dist:zip`, `npm run dist:nsis` (on windows), archives `dist/` as release artifacts, and tags the release in GitHub.
